    <div> <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Andre Jacques Pujol and I am a web developer based out of Baton Rouge, LA. My
       love for coding began when I started teaching my self how to make video games in Unreal and Unity.
       Eventually I decided to make the pivot to web technologies and attended a coding boot camp at Full Stack Academy. 
       After that I started my own company, Blue Period Web Solutions, and I focus on helping small businesses establish an online presence. I am currently open
       to developer roles.
